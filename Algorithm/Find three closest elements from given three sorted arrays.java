Given three sorted arrays A[], B[] and C[], find 3 elements i, j and k from A, B and C respectively such that max(abs(A[i] – B[j]), abs(B[j] – C[k]), abs(C[k] – A[i])) is minimized. Here abs() indicates absolute value.

Example :

Input: A[] = {1, 4, 10}
       B[] = {2, 15, 20}
       C[] = {10, 12}
Output: 10 15 10
10 from A, 15 from B and 10 from C

Input: A[] = {20, 24, 100}
       B[] = {2, 19, 22, 79, 800}
       C[] = {10, 12, 23, 24, 119}
Output: 24 22 23
24 from A, 22 from B and 23 from C
