Superficially the behavior of these method might look similar - acquire()/await() 
can make threads block in some cirsumstances and release()/signal() can unblock threads in some circumstances. 
However Semaphore and Condition serve different purposes:

java.util.concurrent.Semaphore is relatively higher-level synchronization mechanism, 
intended for use by general developers. You would use it typically to restrict concurrent access to some 
resource by making each requester thread call acquire() before accessing the resource 
(that way making the thread block if no semaphore permit was available). Description from the javadoc:
    
    
public class Example {
    private int value = 0;

    private final Semaphore mutex = new Semaphore(1)

    public int getNextValue() throws InterruptedException {
        try {
            mutex.acquire();
            return value++;
        } finally {
            mutex.release();
        }
    }
}

Again from The Little Book of Semaphores, ยง2.2:

Listing 2.1: Semaphore initialization syntax

fred = Semaphore(1)
The function Semaphore is a constructor; it creates and returns a new Semaphore. 
The initial value of the semaphore is passed as a parameter to the constructor.
So in the author's pseduocode, 0 isn't the number of permits; 
it's the initial value of the semaphore. What does a value of zero mean? 
It's explained in the text immediately proceeding listing 2.1:
If the value is positive, then it represents the number of threads that can decrement without blocking. 
If it is negative, then it represents the number of threads that have blocked and are waiting.
If the value is zero, it means there are no threads waiting, but if a thread tries to decrement, it will block.
